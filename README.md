<p align="left">
As a Computer Science student, I'm fascinated by the constant duel between system exploitation and protection. This curiosity drives my hands-on work, from building defensive SIEM labs to analyzing attacker tools and deconstructing threats in CTFs. I leverage my understanding of how systems are built to better understand how they break. I am actively seeking roles in SOC analysis or penetration testing where I can apply my analytical skills to real-world security challenges. 
</p>

- 🔭 I’m currently analyzing new malware samples and documenting my findings on my **Medium blog**.
- 🌱 I’m always active on platforms like **TryHackMe** and **LetsDefend** to sharpen my offensive and defensive skills.
- 💬 Ask me about **Malware Analysis, Reverse Engineering (Ghidra), SIEM architecture, or CTFs!**

### 🚀 My Projects & Hands-On Work

<!-- Project 1: SIEM Lab -->
<p>
  <strong><a href="https://github.com/sohankanna/Wazuh-SOC-Lab">Automated SIEM & EDR Lab with Wazuh</a></strong><br/>
  Designed and built a fully functional Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) lab from the ground up. This project uses Wazuh to provide EDR capabilities, centralizing log collection and security monitoring for multiple endpoints to detect simulated attacks.
  <br/>
  <em>Technologies: Wazuh, Elastic Stack (ELK), VirtualBox, Linux, Python</em>
</p>

<!-- Project 2: Phishing Tool -->
<p>
  <strong><a href="https://github.com/[your-github-username]/[repo-name-for-phishing-tool]">Phishing Campaign Simulator</a></strong><br/>
  A Python-based tool developed to conduct controlled phishing simulations for security awareness training. The application sends customized email templates and hosts a tracking server to measure campaign effectiveness.
  <br/>
  <em>Technologies: Python, SMTP, Django, HTML/CSS</em>
</p>

<!-- Project 3: Write-ups -->
<p>
  <strong><a href="https://medium.com/@sohankanna">Security Challenge & SOC Alert Analysis Write-ups</a></strong><br/>
  All my detailed walkthroughs for TryHackMe labs and my analysis of real-world SOC alerts from the LetsDefend platform, documenting my approach to both offensive and defensive security challenges.
